        <p>
            This website examines the dramatic shift that occurred across the 1990s as the World Wide Web evolved from a decentralized, 
            hobbyist-driven network into a highly commercialized digital marketplace. In the early part of the decade, online spaces were 
            built by individuals and small communities who valued experimentation, anonymity, and open information-sharing. By the late 
            1990s, however, large corporations had begun to dominate the web, introducing structured e-commerce platforms, targeted advertising 
            models, and data-driven user analytics. This transformation not only reshaped how people interacted with websites but also redefined
            the very purpose of the internet. This marks a turning point where creativity and communal experimentation increasingly gave way to
            monetization, branding, and consumer-oriented design.

                In the early 1990s, the web was an unruly, loosely connected space characterized by user-generated homepages, niche forums,
                and a sense of digital frontier exploration. Most users accessed the web out of curiosity or to participate in emerging 
                subcultures, not to shop or be marketed to. But as the decade progressed, technological developments such as secure online 
                payment systems, cookies for tracking user activity, and increasingly intuitive web browsers created the infrastructure 
                necessary for commercial expansion. Companies like Amazon and eBay capitalized on this environment, while advertising networks 
                introduced banners, click-through metrics, and later the pop-up ad. These shifts fundamentally reoriented the web toward 
                profitability, laying early foundations for the data-driven, personalized, and corporate internet we experience today
