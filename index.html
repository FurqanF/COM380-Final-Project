        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            During the 1990s, the Internet transformed from a largely hobbyist, academic, and creative space 
            into a commercial environment shaped by eCommerce and advertising. While early online culture 
            emphasized anonymity, experimentation, and personal expression, the rapid rise of online 
            businesses and increasingly aggressive advertising techniques brought new expectations, 
            new forms of user behavior, and new tensions about what the web was becoming.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website explores the twin developments of <strong>eCommerce</strong> and 
            <strong>web advertising</strong>—two forces that eventually converged into the hyper-commercialized 
            web we experience today.

        <h2>Early eCommerce (1994–2000)</h2>
        <p>
            Although eCommerce is commonplace today, online shopping in the 1990s was limited, experimental, 
            and met with skepticism. Major platforms like Amazon (1994) and eBay (1995) pioneered new models 
            of trust, logistics, and digital payment. Yet consumer buying remained relatively small until the 
            late 1990s, and overall Internet traffic was dominated by communication, research, gaming, 
            and personal homepages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite this, the <strong>symbolic significance</strong> of eCommerce was enormous: it signaled that 
            the Internet could become a marketplace, not just a creative or informational network. Startups 
            raced to become the next big online retailer, and venture capital poured into businesses with 
            uncertain futures.

        <h2>Web Advertising in the 1990s</h2>
        <p>
            Advertising appeared on the web as early as the early 1990s, but it grew dramatically in scale 
            and aggressiveness as the decade progressed. Banner ads spread across major websites, 
            and advertisers sought new ways to capture attention and track user behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the mid-to-late 1990s, the landscape included pop-up ads, ad networks, and the first attempts 
            at personalization through cookies. These techniques laid the groundwork for the 
            <strong>surveillance-driven advertising economy</strong> that defines today's commercial web.

    <section id="culture" class="content-box">
        <h2>Impact on Internet Culture</h2>
        <p>
            The rise of eCommerce and advertising reshaped the Internet's identity. Users increasingly became 
            customers and data points, and websites shifted their design and content toward profit-oriented 
            models. The creative, decentralized spirit of early web culture continued to exist, but it was 
            increasingly overshadowed by commercial ambitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            These dual developments—selling <em>to</em> users and selling <em>users themselves</em>—would eventually 
            merge in the 2000s as platforms learned to monetize not only transactions but attention, 
            behavior, and identity.
